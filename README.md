Oh this seems a little "Dry" - I'm a Mathematician and Data Scientist. I have an academic interest in Graph Theory. I like alot of things, I love to travel - I love Sports - I love Nature - I love Movies - I love Food. I love to share all these things where I can with my Wife and new Puppy "Cole", who as I type is grissling in the room next to me.
